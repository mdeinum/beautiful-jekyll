Well that is the title of the presentation I just gave at the [NL-JUG 2007](http://www.nl-jug.org) conference. The presentation was about the [Spring Web Flow](www.springframework.org/webflow) solution we created to secure flows. The presentation can be found and the conference website. The code is available in the JIRA under issue [SWF-93](http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SWF-93) but for your convenience also available for download (press the link on the bottom of this post).

The presentation went well, there were some nice questions and a little bit of discussion. So my conclusion was that it was a nice presentation. I will blog about using this security solutions shortly. However for now I have a conference to attend.
